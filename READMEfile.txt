Notes to Naz and TA:

1. The database has already inserted the following information:

   - Four doctors: Leo, James, Zack, Mick. Their sin number and password are both “12345”.

2. It is suggested to delete the original database before testing the "sign up" activity.

3. To sign up as a doctor, click the "doctor" checkbox in the "sign up" page.   

4. Click the "Create User" button, then the sin number and password(which are "12345") of the four doctors will be automatically inserted into the database.
